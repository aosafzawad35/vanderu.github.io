			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<p>A top global university, Vanderbunk pushes the boundaries of discovery to make a better world while providing students with life-changing opportunities. Founded in 2001 in Bangladesh, and named after our biggest lifetime donor, Vought Vanderbunk, VanderU cherishes every student that enters its halls. VanderU hopes to create a society with no hierarchies, where all professions are respected equally in society, yet also a place where everybody can have something to work on. VanderU hopes to encourage research and foster both personal and economic growth between individuals. VanderU also hopes to allow students to pursue their dreams and for those who still do not have one, we also have them covered. VanderU understands that young adults may not have their lives planned out, and it is absolutely fine. VanderU wants everyone in the society to be able to help out and make a difference, by giving students access to education. </p>
