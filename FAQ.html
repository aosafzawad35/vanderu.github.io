			<h3>Question 2: Will food be able on campus?</h3>
			<p>Answer: VanderU will provide breakfast, lunch and dinner on-campus and the cafeteria of our university will be open for most of the day for $3800 a year, but this service is optional and there are many restaurants in the area that VaderU is located in. VanderU also respects everyone's dietary restrictions, whether they be health-related or for religion, hence we keep that in mind before serving our students food.</p>

		<article class="qa">
			<h3>Question 3: Can the meal plans be more diversified?</h3>
			<p>Answer: We have heard numerous complaints from the students who have been subscribing to our meal plan that they have got immensely bored of our meal plans. So, we have tried to diversify our meals by serving something different everyday which also gave rise to more complaints from students. In order to satisfy everyone, VanderU has allowed for buffets during breakfast, lunch and dinner and has also allowed students to only have breakfast on-campus for a price of $1200 a year.</p>

		<article class="qa">
			<h3>Question 4: Why are the subject choices so limited?</h3>
			<p>VanderU is a relatively young university with very little funding, hence we have not been able to expand upon the current options. VanderU is also somewhat landlocked as a university with only one campus, so expanding our facilities cannot be done as of now.</p>

		<article class="qa">
			<h3>Question 5: Why didn't I qualify for scholarships even though I fulfilled all the requirements?</h3>
			<p>Answer: Each scholarship is limited to only a specific number of students. If you don't get offered one, it does not mean you were unworthy of one, it just means that someone was worthier than you. Many applications come in everyday, not to worry, you may also be offered a scholarship mid-course if you perform well enough.</p>

		<article class="qa">
			<h3>Question 6: How old must one be to apply for Undergraduates or Masters?</h3>
			<p>Answer: Although we do not have an age limit, we do have requirements. For applying for undergraduates, one should have a higher secondary certification of at least some kind such as the A levels. As for the Master's programs, one should definitely have an undergraduate certificate with a GPA of at least 2.5 from any respected university.</p>

		<article class="qa">
			<h3>Question 7: What will be the cost of my tuition once I enroll?</h3>
			<p>Answer:- Each course package has a different cost, however on average, an undergraduate student with no scholarship pays $40,000 per year and a student in the master's program pays $60,000 per year. This, however, does not include dormitory rent, the meal costs or the price of the books you have to buy during the whole program.</p>

		<article class="qa">
			<h3>Question 8: What is the rent of the dormitories and is it compulsory for me to stay there?</h3>
			<p>Answer: First of all, one room costs $6000 yearly and it is only mandatory for international students to stay in the dorms for only the first semester. National students are highly discouraged from using our dormitories.</p>
		</article>
		<article class="qa">
			<h3>Question 9: Do parties take place on the premises?</h3>
			<p>Answer: Alcohol and/or narcotics are strictly prohibited in the University Campus and anyone found in possession of these substances will be expelled immediately. Along with that, since most parties encourage substance use, we refuse to conduct any sort of parties in our campus. However, yearly balls do take place on our campus, which are usually extremely extravagant. </p>
