			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>At VanderU, we believe many problems exist in this world and we also believe that we must strive to find the solutions of these problems. A certain religious leader had said, "Whoever travels a path in search of knowledge, God will make easy for him a path to Paradise". The Vanderbunk University lives and operates by these words and we hope to instill these values onto all our students as well. </p>

				<h4>Zero Knowledge Proofs</h4>
				<p>Research is currently being done at our facilities by the CS faculty and master program students about Zero Knowledge proofs to create password authentication without the collecting of data of users in the form of passwords. If this project can reach its conclusions, then we may be seeing the disappearance of the password system entirely.</p>

				<h4>Energy-Constant Systems</h4>
				<p>The faculty of Physics is conducting many studies in order to create minimum heat loss systems in order to create energy-efficient systems which can be used in industries to reduce energy loss and also reduce the need for excessive fuel as well as capital.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid">
				<h4>Dirt Collecting Formula</h4>
				<p>The faculty of Chemistry, and many other independent environmentalists along with our students have been working on this project for creating a chemical that could clean the world's filthiest rivers, along with the implementation of the findings of the projects in order to create a cleaner world.</p>

				<h4>Women in Advertising</h4>
				<p>The brilliant business faculty of VanderU had prepared a wonderful report on the psychological effect that women in advertisement have on many people and have concluded how it may be the leading cause of objectification and sexism they may face in their work. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid">
				<h4>Ecosystem Preservation</h4>
				<p>The Chemistry department of VanderU has prepared a very detailed and immaculate report as to how we can theoretically create entire artificial ecosystems for aquariums without having to transfer animals there from the sea. This paper also emphasizes how we can use these systems to preserve endangered species.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid">
				<h4>Optimal Security Solutions</h4>
				<p>The CS department of VanderU has also previously worked on creating optimal password storing and encryption algorithms and after a very strenuous couple of years, have devised a customizable algorithm that can be used by developers to create a safe data storing system that does not affect the speed of the application.</p>
